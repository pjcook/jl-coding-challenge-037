# Challenge #37

I like to have different fruit for lunch. Somedays I like to have an Apple and other days I like to have an Orange and other days I like to have both. In fact I’ve found that I like to have any of the following fruit for Lunch:

 - Orange
 - Apple
 - Pear
 - Grapes
 - Nectarine

I’ve also noticed I can eat up to five different fruits each lunch time but I will never eat more than one of the same fruit on the same day.

In this challenge you need to determine what combinations of different fruit I can have for lunch. For example, one of the combinations I could have for lunch could be Grapes, Apple and Nectarine. The order that I eat the fruit doesn’t matter so for the purpose of this exercise Grapes, Apple and Nectarine is the same as Nectarine, Grapes and Apple.

The function signature will look something like this:

{code}
function possibleLunch(fruits: Array<Fruit> )  returns Array<Array<Fruit>>>
{code}
 
Your programming language of choice may make this very easy for you by providing a function, or a library that can solve the problem for you. If that is the case you may find it more challenging to design your own algortim rather than just use the off the shelf solution.

You may want to increase the number of fruits in your tests to 20 or more to see whether your algorithm perfoms well as I get greedier. I also like Strawberries, Plums, Blueberries, Clementine, Banana, Blackberries, Melon, Mango, Kiwifriut, Pomegranate, Apricot, Coconut, Grapefruit, Tangerine, Cherries and Tomato.
